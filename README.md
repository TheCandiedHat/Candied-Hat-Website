## Know what GameMaker Studio is?
Then you've come to the right place. 
This website is all about GameMaker Studio.
We have tutorials on DnD, GML, and mixtures of the two.

## Don't know what GameMaker Studio is?
Well, if you want to make 2D games, you've still come to the right place.
[GameMaker Studio](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/features) is a 2D game engine!
Click on the link to find out more about it! And the best part is, it's completely free! No royalties or other fees. 
Well, there are quite a few fees, but they don't have to be payed. You don't need to buy anything in order to make a game in GameMaker Studio.
1 thing though, the tutorials they have aren't the BEST. They're good, but they can be confusing sometimes. And, well, they don't teach you everything.
That's why I've decided to make this website.
Also, the built-in sprite editors are horrible, so we added some better stuff for that.

## Professional GameMaker Studio developer?
Awesome! Just e-mail me [here](stupidjunkmail000@gmail.com and we can talk about you joining the team developing this website.
Of course, you can just make youtube videos if you want. Or even text tutorials! (I'd love if every tutorial could be in both formats).

### So, now that you know what this is, go try it out!
